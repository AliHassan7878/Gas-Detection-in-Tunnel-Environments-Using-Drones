# Gas Detection in Tunnel Environments Using Drones

## Overview
Developed a drone-based gas detection system for tunnel environments, enabling real-time monitoring and improving safety in confined spaces.  
Handled the entire project lifecycle, from requirements engineering to testing and demonstration.

## Features
- Drone-mounted sensors for detecting hazardous gases.  
- Real-time data acquisition and monitoring.  
- Alerts for unsafe gas concentrations.  

## Technologies
- Python   
- Drone hardware integration  
- Gas sensor modules 

## My Role
- Gathered requirements and designed the detection workflow.  
- Integrated sensor data with autonomous drone navigation.  
- Conducted testing in simulated and real tunnel environments.
- Collected gas sensor data with multiple experiments by integrating gas sensor on different positions.
- Performed detailed data analysis and data visualization.
- Provided documentation and demonstrations for the client and internal team.  

## Results
- Enabled safe monitoring of hazardous environments remotely.  
- Improved situational awareness and reduced risk to personnel.
